### Abstract
- Architectures with **augmented memory** capacities, such as Neural Turing Machines (NTMs), offer the ability to **quickly encode and retrieve new information**, and hence can potentially obviate the *downsides of conventional models*.
    - When new data is encountered, the **conventional models must inefficiently relearn their parameters** to adequately incorporate the new information without catastrophic interference.
- We also introduce a **new method for accessing an external memory that focuses on memory content**, unlike previous methods that additionally use memory location-based focusing mechanisms.

## Cross-Domain Few-Shot Classification. ICLR 2020
- [code - official (PyTorch)](https://github.com/hytseng0509/CrossDomainFewShot)
- **metric-based** few-shot classification often fail to generalize to unseen domains due to **large discrepancy** of the feature distribution across domains.
- core idea is to use **feature-wise transformation layers** for **augmenting the image features** using affine transforms to **simulate various feature distributions** under different domains in the **training stage**.
- further apply a **learning-to-learn approach to search for the hyper-parameters** of the **feature-wise transformation layers**.
    - optimize the feature-wise transformation layers so that the model can **work well on the unseen domains** after training the **model using the seen domains**.
- modulated activations $\hat z_{c,h,w}=\gamma_c\times z_{c,h,w}+\beta_c$
    - $\gamma\sim N(1,\text{softplus}(\theta_\gamma))$
    - $\beta\sim N(0,\text{softplus}(\theta_\beta))$
    - $\theta_\gamma,\theta_\beta$ are hyperparameters.

## Label Efficient Learning of Transferable Representations across Domains and Tasks. NIPS 2017 (Li Fei-Fei)

- Our model is simultaneously optimized on **labeled source data and unlabeled or sparsely labeled data in the target domain**.
- Our method shows compelling results on **novel classes within a new domain** even when **only a few labeled examples per class** are available, outperforming the prevalent fine-tuning approach.
- initialize the CNN for the target tasks in the target domain by a **pre-trained CNN learning from source tasks** in source domain. During training, they use an **adversarial loss** calculated from **representations in multiple layers** of CNN to force the two CNNs projects samples to a **task-invariant space**.


## One Shot Domain Adaptation for Person Re-Identification. 2018

## Meta-Learning with Domain Adaptation for Few-Shot Learning under Domain Shift, ICLR 19 rejected
- ProtoNet + CycleGAN?
### reviewer comment at [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByGOuo0cYm)
- The proposed approach consists of **combining** a known few shot learning model, prototypical nets, together with image to image translation via CycleGAN for domain adaptation.  Thus the **algorithmic novelty is minor** and amounts to combining two techniques to address a different problem statement. 
- though meta learning could be a solution to learn with few examples, the solution being used in this work is **not meta learning** and so should not be in the title to avoid confusion.

- 需要 target domain **unlabeled** data
- [My paper note](https://hackmd.io/VqkHvFGIToqGWsfSwLg6bA?view)
- [code - official (TF)](https://github.com/leonndong/DAOSL)
### Abstract
- given only one example of each new class. Can we **transfer knowledge learned by oneshot learning from one domain to another**?
- propose a **domain adaption framework based on adversarial networks**. 
- This framework is **generalized for situations where the source and target domain have different labels**.
- use a **policy network**, inspired by human learning behaviors, to effectively **select samples from the source domain in the training process**. This sampling strategy can further improve the domain adaption performance.

- [中文](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/64672817)
- [code - official (PyTorch)](https://github.com/wyharveychen/CloserLookFewShot)
- 提出兩個普通 baseline，發現許多情況可以和 SOTA 的 fewshot learning 媲美
- 比較的 SOTA 方法：MatchingNet、ProtoNet、RelationNet、MAML
- domain 差異小的情況下(例如CUBS)，隨著 baseNN 越強，不同 SOTA 方法的差異越小
- domain 差異大的情況下(例如miniImageNet)，隨著 baseNN 越強，不同 SOTA 方法的差異越大
- 有領域飄移情況發生時，SOTA 方法甚至沒有 baseline 表現好
- 特別強調 SOTA 在 domain adaptation 做得不好

### Reviewer Comment
- The conclusion from the network depth experiments is that “**gaps among different methods diminish as the backbone gets deeper**”. However, in a **5-shot mini-ImageNet case, this is not what the plot shows**. Quite the opposite: the **gap increased**. Did I misunderstand something? Could you please comment on that?
    - **跟我想問的問題一樣**
    - Authors' Answer: Sorry for the confusion. As addressed in 4.3, gaps among different methods diminish as the backbone gets deeper *in the CUB dataset*. In the mini-ImageNet dataset, the results are more complicated due to the domain difference. We further discuss this phenomenon in Section 4.4 and 4.5. We have clarified related texts in the revised paper. 

## Few-shot Learning with Meta Metric Learners. NIPS 2017 workshop on Meta-Learning, arXiv 1901.09890
- Microsoft AI & Research, IBM Research AI, JD AI Research
- Sentence Classification Services / Omniglot / Amazon Reviews
- Existing meta-learning or metric-learning based few-shot learning approaches are **limited in handling diverse domains** with various number of labels. 
- we proposed a meta metric learner for few-shot learning, which is a **combination of an LSTM meta-learner and a base metric classifier**.
- The proposed method takes several advantages such as is able to **handle unbalanced classes** as well as to **generate task-specific metrics**.
- We test our approach in the ‘k-shot N-way’ few-shot learning setting used in previous work and new realistic few-shot setting with **diverse multi-domain tasks and flexible label numbers**.
- contributions
    1. improve the existing few-shot learning work to **handle various class labels (not only k-shot N-way)**
    2. enable the model to **learn task specific metrics** via training a meta learner
    3. we are the first to investigate **few-shot deep learning methods in the text domains**.

## Delta-encoder: an effective sample synthesis method for few-shot object recognition. NIPS 2018
- Data method: learned transformation

### Abstract
- Our approach is based on a **modified auto-encoder**, denoted delta-encoder, that learns to **synthesize new samples for an unseen category just by seeing few examples** from it. The synthesized samples are then used to train a classifier.
- proposed approach learns to both **extract transferable intra-class deformations**, or "**deltas**", between same-class pairs of training examples, and to **apply those deltas** to the few provided examples of a **novel class** (unseen during training) in order to efficiently **synthesize samples from that new class**.

### the delta-encoder
![](https://i.imgur.com/XCGtXRv.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/rl5xJtP.png)
- The simple key idea of this work is to **change the meaning of $E(X)$** from representing the "essence" of $X$, to representing the delta, or **"additional information" needed to reconstruct $X$ from $Y$** (an observed example from the same category).
    - $E$ for encoder, $D$ for decoder

## Adaptive Cross-Modal Few-Shot Learning, ICLR 2019 Workshop LLD, arXiv 1902
- 這篇跟我本來想到的 idea 一樣，居然有人做過了，機車
- 不過也許還沒做 domain shift?
- 對，他沒做 domain shift 哈哈哈哈

### Reviewer Comment
- this paper is **not really doing few-shot learning**, because according to section 3.2. and the experiments, the authors use the test labels in order to know which word embeddings to assign to each sample: "[...] containing label embeddings of all categories in D_train ∪ D_test". In other words, the authors use the labels (which are the goal of the classification task) to find the match between the two input modalities (to know what Glove vector to assign to each image).
- the experiments compare the results only between this multimodal approach and visual approaches. I believe using the Glove embeddings alone (no visual input) could give very good results on their own, and it is thus crucial for the authors to compare with this scenario too.
- the explanation for why you chose this form for lambda_c is unclear: "A very structured semantic space is a good choice for conditioning."

- motivation：在特征上做数据增广不足以考察类内的变化-->在语义空间上做数据增广。
- 方法：
    1. 提取类别的语义空间（人工标注的语义属性空间；word2vec得到的语义word空间）
    2. 联合训练一个特征提取器和视觉特征空间到语义空间的映射。
    3. 对于测试的训练图像，将其映射到语义空间，在语义空间做数据增广（加入高斯噪声或者映射到相应的相似的类别），再映射到语义空间，得到增广后的特征。
    4. 将增广的特征和原有的特征联合训练一个分类器。

- 只在一些 $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$ 的 prediction loss 高於 threshold 時去更新 memory。因此相較於 differentiable memory(**_???_**)，計算成本降低了
- approximates probability distributions by **remembering the most surprising observations**
- algorithm can perform as well as state of the art baselines
- main contributions:
    - surprise-based signal to write items to memory, **not needing to learn what to write**. So easier and faster to train, and minimizes how much data stored
    - ***(不懂???) An integrated external and working memory architecture which can take advantage of the best of both worlds: scalability and sparse access provided by the working memory; and all-to-all attention and reasoning provided by a relational reasoning module.***
    - A training setup which steers the system towards learning an algorithm which **approximates the posterior without backpropagating through the whole sequence of data in an episode**.
- Conclusion
    - We introduced a self-contained system which can **learn to approximate a probability distribution with as little data and as quickly as it can**. This is achieved by:
        - putting together the training setup which encourages adaptation
        - an external memory which allows the system to recall past events
        - a writing system to adapt the memory to uncertain situations
        - a working memory architecture which can efficiently compare items retrieved from memory to produce new predictions
    - We showed that the model can
        - Reach **state of the art accuracy with a smaller memory footprint** than other meta-learning models by efficiently choosing which data points to remember.
        - **Scale to very large problem sizes** thanks to the use of an external memory module **with sparse access**.
        - ***(不懂???) Perform fewer than 1-shot generalization thanks to relational reasoning across neighbors.***

- 方法 (**改良 MAML**)
    1. 用 training set 所有 sample 訓練一個 NN 來 classify，得到一個 feature extractor
    2. sample 多個 task，用 MAML 根據 support set 更新 classifier(最後一層?) 參數，再利用 query set 計算 gradient，微調 initial parameter
- **Hard Task(HT) meta-batch**
    - 故意選一些 fail 的 task 並重組那些 data 成為 harder tasks 以用來 adverse re-training，希望 meta-learner 能在困難中成長 0.0

## Learning from Adversarial Features for Few-Shot Classification. CVPR'19

### [few-shot 知乎](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/58298920)

- motivation: 分类的交叉熵loss只会关注最显著的区域，会造成提取特征的严重过拟合。通过约束模型更加关注其他区域的特征，提高特征提取器的泛化能力。
- 方法：
    1. 输入图像，经过特征提取器得到特征F，经过分类器，得到概率分布，以及entropy loss $l$
    2. 求的entropy loss对输入特征F的梯度，在初始的M上加上其梯度（新得到M使entropy loss更大）。
    3. 将新得到的M与输入特征F相乘，求平均，经过分类器，得到cross entropy loss $l_1$
    4. 将F再经过多个卷积层，使其空间维度为1，经过分类器，得到cross entropy loss $l_2$
    5. 通过 $l_1+l_2$ 优化网络

## TapNet: Neural Network Augmented with Task-Adaptive Projection for Few-Shot Learning. ICML'19
- 不是 domain shift
### Abstract
- Handling previously unseen tasks after given only a few training examples continues to be a tough challenge in machine learning. We propose TapNets, neural networks augmented with task-adaptive projection for improved few-shot learning. Here, employing a meta-learning strategy with **episode-based training**, **a network** and **a set of per-class reference vectors** are learned across widely varying tasks. At the same time, for every episode, **features** in the embedding space are **linearly projected** into a new space as a form of quick **task-specific conditioning**. The training loss is obtained based on a **distance metric between the query and the reference vectors** in the projection space. Excellent generalization results in this way. When tested on the Omniglot, miniImageNet and **tieredImageNet** datasets, we obtain state of the art classification accuracies under **various few-shot scenarios**.

## Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning. ICML'19

### Abstract
- We propose **CAVIA** for meta-learning, a simple extension to **MAML** that is **less prone to meta-overfitting**, easier to parallelise, and more **interpretable**.
- CAVIA partitions the model parameters into two parts: **context parameters** that serve as **additional input** to the model and are **adapted on individual tasks**, and **shared parameters** that are meta-trained and **shared across tasks**. At **test time, only the context parameters are updated**, leading to a low-dimensional task representation.
